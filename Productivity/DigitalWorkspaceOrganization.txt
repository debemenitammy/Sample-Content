File Naming Conventions

Adopt a consistent naming convention for your files. Include keywords related to the file's content and date of creation to make searching easier.

Cloud Storage Solutions

Consider using cloud storage services like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive to store your files. These platforms offer ample space and facilitate sharing among team members.
