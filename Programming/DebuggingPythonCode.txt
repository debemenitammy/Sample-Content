Introduction to Debugging in Python

Debugging is a crucial part of the software development process. It involves identifying and removing errors from computer programs. In Python, there are several methods to debug your code, ranging from simple print statements to using specialized modules like pdb.

Using Print Statements

One of the simplest ways to debug Python code is by using print statements. By inserting print statements at various points in your code, you can track the flow of execution and inspect variable values.

The PDB Module

For more complex debugging scenarios, Python provides the pdb module. This interactive source debugger allows you to pause your program, examine data structures, and execute commands within the program's context.

Best Practices

Use descriptive variable names to make debugging easier.
Comment your code to explain the purpose of complex logic.
Break down large functions into smaller, manageable pieces.
